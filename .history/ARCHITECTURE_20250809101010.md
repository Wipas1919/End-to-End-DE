# Data Platform Architecture - On-Premise Implementation

## System Design Philosophy

This data platform was architected with several key principles in mind:

1. **On-Premise First**: All components run on-premise for data sovereignty and security
2. **Hybrid Semantics**: Only semantic layer leverages Microsoft Fabric for advanced analytics
3. **Modular Design**: Each layer operates independently while maintaining clear interfaces
4. **Security First**: All data flows go through proper authentication and authorization
5. **Scalability**: Components can be scaled independently based on demand
6. **Governance**: Centralized metadata management ensures data quality and compliance
7. **Operational Excellence**: Comprehensive monitoring and automation throughout
8. **Team Collaboration**: Clear separation of responsibilities between Data Platform and Infrastructure teams
