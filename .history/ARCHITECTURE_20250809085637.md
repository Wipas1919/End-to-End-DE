# Data Platform Architecture - On-Premise Implementation

## System Design Philosophy

This data platform was architected with several key principles in mind:

1. **On-Premise First**: All components run on-premise for data sovereignty and security
2. **Hybrid Semantics**: Only semantic layer leverages Microsoft Fabric for advanced analytics
3. **Modular Design**: Each layer operates independently while maintaining clear interfaces
4. **Security First**: All data flows go through proper authentication and authorization
5. **Scalability**: Components can be scaled independently based on demand
6. **Governance**: Centralized metadata management ensures data quality and compliance
7. **Operational Excellence**: Comprehensive monitoring and automation throughout

## On-Premise Architecture Overview

### Key Changes from Cloud-First to On-Premise

1. **Data Processing**: All ETL and data processing moved to on-premise using Windmill
2. **Storage**: Complete on-premise storage with MySQL, InfluxDB, and MinIO
3. **Visualization**: On-premise dashboards with limited Power BI integration
4. **Semantics Layer**: Only semantic modeling and advanced analytics remain on Microsoft Fabric
5. **Security**: Enhanced on-premise security with Azure AD integration for identity management
